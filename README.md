# HorchataMapper

###Welcome to Horchata Mapper!
This is a project based on an idea I had long time ago, but which I couldn't get into because of lack of knowledge (and because I was not bored enough I guess).

The objective of this is to create a random map generator based on polygons, mainly designed for rol games and things like that. The idea of the fiinal product is to being able to generate your own and customized maps, based on parametters like the map size.

I don't know how did you reach this place, neither I care. This is still an ongoing project, so there is not much to see yet. I will update this project whenever I can.
I'm making it open-source, so all kind of comments and ideas are welcome.
